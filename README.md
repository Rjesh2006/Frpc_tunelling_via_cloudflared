# *first understand that what is frpc tunneling is :--‚è¨*
  - *FRPC tunneling is a method of securely exposing services from a local network to the internet by creating a tunnel between a local machine and a remote server. It allows you to access local services from 
     anywhere without compromising security.*


 **Frpc_tunelling_via_cloudflared**
  - cloudflared: *Cloudflared is a tool by Cloudflare for creating secure tunnels between a user's network and Cloudflare's network. It helps bypass restrictions, enhances security, and allows secure access to 
    internal resources from anywhere on the internet.*
    - How it  works : [How it works
Cloudflared establishes outbound connections (tunnels) between your resources and Cloudflare‚Äôs global network. Tunnels are persistent objects that route traffic to DNS records. Within the same tunnel, you can run as many ‚Äòcloudflared‚Äô processes (connectors) as needed. These processes will establish connections to Cloudflare and send traffic to the nearest Cloudflare data center.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)

 - *Frpc----tunneling through     Cloud_Flared*
    - *The commmand is for (windows cmd) its a simple proccess here:--
    ```
    winget install --id Cloudflare.cloudflare
    ```
  
  - *check the the version if cloudflared is sucessfuly installed :‚è¨
   ```
   cloudflared --version
   ```

 ```
  cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
 ```
**Here's what each part of the command does:**

- *cloudflared tunnel: Initiates the Cloudflare tunneling service.*
*url http://localhost:3000: Specifies the URL to which traffic should be forwarded through the tunnel. In this case, it's http://localhost:3000, meaning traffic directed to localhost on port 3000 of your local 
  machine will be tunneled.*
- *This command is useful when you want to expose a local service running on your machine (localhost:3000 in this case) to the internet via Cloudflare's network, enabling access to the service from anywhere with 
   enhanced security and performance provided by Cloudflare.*

***NOTE--üìï*** 
*whenever you will write this commands (  cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000) it will give u a temporary **Domain name** which will work as as a real domain name but the condition is your localhost server should be at running state so that the temporary (Domain name ) will forward all request to ur localhot server then other user can acess ur  web -application publicaly.*
